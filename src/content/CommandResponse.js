  <br/>

  <p><span class="highlight">Early Life:</span></p>

  <br/>

  <p>Kelsey was raised out in the town of Sooke, and enjoyed fishing, hiking and everything Sooke had to offer a youth.</p>

  <p>He spent much of his time with friends, playing videos games, and getting into mischief.</p>

  <br/>

  <p><span class="highlight">Adulthood:</span></p>

  <br/>

  <p>When Kelsey turned 18 he needed to get out of Sooke and explore what the world had to offer. He packed his bags and moved 1 hour away to the beautiful city of Victoria.</p>

  <p>During Kelsey's 20s he spent a few years working in the trades, and trying to figure out where he fit into this world.</p>

  <p>Not being challenged by the trades, and feeling a need for more, Kelsey enrolled in The Pacific Design Academy to persue a career in Graphic Design.</p>

  <br/>

  <p><span class="highlight">A developer is born:</span></p>

  <br/>

  <p>During Kelsey's education in design he was introduced to rudimentary web developement.</p>

  <p>This introduction turned into a passion. Kelsey spent his days diving into the world of code and programming instead of designing.</p>

  <p>After a few years of learning code on his own, Kelsey decided the next step would be to enroll in a Bootcamp and commit to the developer path.</p>

  <p>In 2017 Kelsey completed the Lighthouse Labs bootcamp in Victoria, and began his journey to becoming a true developer.</p>

  <p>Post Lighthouse Labs Kelsey worked on a number of personal and paid for projects, including a Shopify shipping app for a wine distributing company<p>

  <p>In July 2018 Kelsey was hired as a Junior developer at Pixel Union, where he learned more about Shopify, and contributed to the launch of large eCommerce stores</p>

  <p>In June of 2019 Kelsey was hired as a contractor for Gearbox Built and was quickly asked to join the team. He worked on many projects including customization of existing Shopify/Wordpress sites, and ground up builds using Wordpress/Sage</p>

  <br/>

  <p><span class="highlight">Present:</span></p>

  <br/>

  <p>Kelsey is on the hunt for a great company, that is looking for their next developer.</p>
